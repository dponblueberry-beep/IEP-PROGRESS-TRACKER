## Technology Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (hosted here via GitHub Pages).
* **Backend (Design):** Oracle SQL (PL/SQL).

## How to View

* **Database Logic:** View the `database.sql` file in this repository to see the table structure and data manipulation logic.

## Conceptual Design
The system connects three main entities:
1.  **Students** (IEP details)
2.  **Objectives** (Measurable goals)
3.  **Assessments** (Daily data points)# IEP-PROGRESS-TRACKER
